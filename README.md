# superstore-sales-analysis
You are a sales manager at Superstore Sales- one of Canada’s largest retail stores. You need to send a report to your manager containing a summary of sales for the Corporate customer segment. The dataset superstore_sales.xlsx is provided below. Most of the data headers are self-explanatory. However, for clarity, following are the meanings of a few data headers: Region: Analogous to a large state in Canada. Province: A district within Region. Product Base Margin: Profit margin on a product.

The final report is to be made for only the Corporate customer segment.

Section 1: Basic Formatting

Increase the column widths to appropriate sizes so that they are readable.
Format the header row in a suitable colour and put borders around the header row cells.
Section 2: Filtering

Filter the data by customer segment.
Create four new worksheets, one for each customer segment.
Copy raw data of each customer segment into the respective worksheet.
Now you’ll have four individual sheets, one for each customer segment. For this assignment, you only have to work with the Corporate customer segment (this point onwards).
Section 3: Report Making - I

Freeze the header row.
Delete or hide any unwanted columns.
Hint: Decide judiciously between which columns should be deleted / hidden.
Round off sales and profits to one decimal place.
Format sales and profit in US dollar units.
Format the Order Date and Ship Date into a more readable format (say 15-Jan 2012, or choose a format that you find the most readable).
Section 4: Report Making - II

Sorting:Sort alphabetically by Region.
Within Region, sort alphabetically by Province.
Within Province, sort in decreasing order of sales.
Conditional Formatting - I:

Within every Region, highlight the top 10% orders by sales in light green fill and dark green border.
Conditional Formatting - II:

To help your manager understand profits better, highlight profits in a scale of green and losses in a scale of red (Higher the profit, darker the shade of green; More the loss, darker the shade of red).
Learning Tip: Learn how to apply multiple conditional formattings in one column.
Section 5: Report Making - III: *NApply double bottom borders to demarcate every Region.

Section 6: Printing, Saving and Exporting to PDF

Experiment with different page layout options to fit the report in minimum number of pages.

Our main objective is to identify the most profitable product sub-categories across each region and the least profitable (most loss-making) product subcategories and if needed, stop selling those product subcategories in the regions where they are the least profitable.

Problem Statement

High-Profit Categories
In this section, you want to identify the most profitable product sub-categories across each region.

Using the raw data, find the top 3 profitable Product Sub-Categories in each region.
Using PIVOT Tables, compare the profit for each of the top 3 profitable product subcategories by region:
Which subcategories are the profitable in most regions?
Sort the rows and columns by profit and apply Conditional Formatting. Does this throw up some exceptions?
Loss Making Categories

Say you want to identify the least profitable (most loss-making) product subcategories and if needed, stop selling those product subcategories in the regions where they are the least profitable.

Find the two most loss-making Product Sub-Categories across all regions.


For these subcategories, identify the regions where they are the least profitable.
Articulate your observations and identify any anomalies that you observe.
Food for thought: People mostly buy tables and chairs together; carefully analyse the business angle of these product categories and form hypotheses to explain your observations.
